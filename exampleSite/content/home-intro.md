# Welcome!

Gofun is a simple Hugo theme based on [tomfran/typo](https://github.com/tomfran/typo) since 2024/12/26, I truly appreciate the thought and effort behind this beautifully minimalistic design.

To enhance its functionality, I’ve added new features and customized some settings:
- Add a new color palette named “**Gofun**”, inspired by same name of the [traditional colors of Japan](https://color-term.com/color/gofun-fffffb/).
- Use awsome font [Bricolage Grotesque](https://github.com/ateliertriay/bricolage) as default.
- Support multiple collection display on homepage.
- Customize your syntax highlighting with a CSS file.
- Add ‘////’ as a divider style, make it more funny.
- Reduce the SVG.html file by using the most common icons.
