# Welcome!

Gofun is a simple Hugo theme based on [tomfran/typo](https://github.com/tomfran/typo), I truly appreciate the thought and effort behind this beautifully minimalistic design.

To enhance its functionality, Iâ€™ve added new features and customized some settings.

Check out the [tutorial](https://github.com/loyistro/gofun.wiki.git) to kickstart your journey with this theme! Your feedback and pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/loyistro/gofun) are always welcome.
